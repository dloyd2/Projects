Code for an adroid app using Flutter. Uses firebase and google sheet/sign in api. This project was built for a nonprofit company. To maintain confidentiality of the company and sensitive project data, certain information has been removed. To mark this, any removed data has been replaced by __REMOVED__

If you are here to review my code, you should look at lib/main.dart

If you are here from the company to expand/modify the project, you should have all necessary files to do so, but will need to re-obtain __REMOVED__ info from firebase, sheets, and the company
